<h3>By JACK DOUGLAS</h3>

<p>Captain Baird stood at
the window of the laboratory
where the thousand parts
of the strange rocket lay strewn
in careful order. Small groups
worked slowly over the dismantled
parts. The captain wanted
to ask but something stopped
him. Behind him Doctor Johannsen
sat at his desk, his
gnarled old hand tight about a
whiskey bottle, the bottle the
doctor always had in his desk
but never brought out except
when he was alone, and waited
for Captain Baird to ask his
question. Captain Baird turned
at last.</p>

<p>"They are our markings?"
Captain Baird asked. It was not
the question. Captain Baird
knew the markings of the Rocket
Testing Station as well as the
doctor did.</p>

<p>"Yes," the doctor said, "they
are our markings. Identical. But
not our paint."</p>

<p>Captain Baird turned back to
the window. Six months ago it
had happened. Ten minutes after
launching, the giant test
rocket had been only a speck on
the observation screen. Captain
Baird had turned away in disgust.</p>

<p>"A mouse!" the captain had
said, "unfortunate a mouse
can't observe, build, report. My
men are getting restless, Johannsen."</p>

<p>"When we are ready, Captain,"
the doctor had said.</p>

<p>It was twelve hours before
the urgent call from Central
Control brought the captain
running back to the laboratory.
The doctor was there before
him. Professor Schultz wasted
no time, he pointed to the instrument
panel. "A sudden
shift, see for yourself. We'll
miss Mars by a million and a
quarter at least."</p>

<p>Two hours later the shift in
course of the test rocket was
apparent to all of them and so
was their disappointment.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"According to the instruments
the steering shifted a
quarter of an inch. No reason
shows up," Professor Schultz
said.</p>

<p>"Flaw in the metal?" Doctor
Johannsen said.</p>

<p>"How far can it go?" Captain
Baird asked.</p>

<p>Professor Schultz shrugged.
"Until the fuel runs out, which
is probably as good as never, or
until the landing mechanism is
activated by a planet-sized
body."</p>

<p>"Course? Did you plot it?"
The doctor asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I did," Professor
Schultz said, "as close as I can
calculate it is headed for Alpha
Centauri."</p>

<p>Captain Baird turned away.
The doctor watched him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will not be quite
so hasty with your men's lives
in the future, Captain?" the doctor
said.</p>

<p>Professor Schultz was spinning
dials. "No contact," the
professor said, "No contact at
all."</p>

<p>That had been six months
ago. Three more test rockets had
been fired successfully before
the urgent report came through
from Alaskan Observation Post
No. 4. A rocket was coming
across the Pole.</p>

<p>The strange rocket was tracked
and escorted by atomic armed
fighters all the way to the
Rocket Testing Station where it
cut its own motors and gently
landed. In the center of a division
of atomic-armed infantry
the captain, the doctor, and
everyone else, waited impatiently.
There was an air of uneasiness.</p>

<p>"You're sure it's not ours?"
Captain Baird asked.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. "Identical,
yes, but three times the size
of ours."</p>

<p>"Perhaps one of the Asian
ones?"</p>

<p>"No, it's our design, but too
large, much too large."</p>

<p>Professor Schultz put their
thoughts into words. "Looks
like someone copied ours. Someone,
somewhere. It's hard to imagine,
but true nevertheless."</p>

<p>They waited two weeks. Nothing
happened. Then a radiation-shielded
team went in to
examine the rocket. Two more
weeks and the strange rocket
was dismantled and spread over
the field of the testing station.
The rocket was dismantled and
the station had begun to talk to
itself in whispers and look at the
sky.</p>

<p>Captain Baird stood now at
the window and looked out at
the dismantled rocket. He looked
but his mind was not on the
parts of the rocket he could see
from the window.</p>

<p>"The materials, they're not
ours?" the captain asked.</p>

<p>"Unknown here," the doctor
said.</p>

<p>The captain nodded. "Those
were our instruments?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The doctor still held
the whiskey bottle in a tight
grip.</p>

<p>"They sent them back," the
captain said.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The doctor crashed the bottle
hard against the desk top. "Ask
it, Captain, for God's sake!!"</p>

<p>The captain turned to face the
doctor directly. "It was a man,
a full grown man."</p>

<p>The doctor sighed as if letting
the pent-up steam of his
heart escape. "Yes, it is a man.
It breathes, it eats, it has all the
attributes of a man. But it is
not of our planet."</p>

<p>"Its speech ..." the captain
began.</p>

<p>"That isn't speech, Captain,"
the doctor broke in, breaking in
sharply, "It's only sound." The
doctor stopped; he examined the
label of his bottle of whiskey
very carefully. A good brand of
whiskey. "He seems quite happy
in the storeroom. You know,
Captain, what puzzled me at
first? He can't read. He can't
read anything, not even the instruments
in that ship. In fact
he shows no interest in his
rocket at all."</p>

<p>The captain sat down now. He
sat at the desk and faced the
doctor. "At least <i>they</i> had the
courage to send a man, not a
mouse. Doctor, a man."</p>

<p>The doctor stared at the captain,
his hand squeezing and unsqueezing
on the whiskey bottle.
"A man who can't read his own
instruments?" The doctor laughed.
"Perhaps you too have failed
to see the point? Like that stupid
general who sits out there
waiting for the men from somewhere
to invade?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's a possibility?"</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. "A very
good possibility, Captain, but
they will not be men." The doctor
seemed to pause and lean
forward. "That rocket, Captain,
is a test rocket. A test rocket
<i>just like ours</i>!"</p>

<p>Then the doctor picked up his
whiskey bottle at last and poured
two glasses.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a drink, Captain?"</p>

<p>The captain was watching the
sky outside the window.</p>
